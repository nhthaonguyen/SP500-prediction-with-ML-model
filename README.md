# SP500-prediction-with-ML-model
I download S&P 500 prices using yfinance package.  Then, preprocessing the data with pandas, and get it ready for machine learning.  

I train a Random Forest model and make predictions using backtesting. Then, I improve the model by adding finance stock indicator (new predictors).
